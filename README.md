# Development has moved!

Development of Sounds in a Dark Room continues [HERE](https://github.com/Cyphre117/Sounds-in-a-dark-Room). This repo contains the very ugly code as it was roughly when the game jam ended plus controller support and some bug fixes.

If you want the last release from this repo, you can get it by clicking on the [releases](https://github.com/Cyphre117/GGJ2017/releases) tab.

Or check out the [global game jam](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/sounds-dark-room) site to see what was actually finished in the 48 hours.
